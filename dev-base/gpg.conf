# When outputting certificates, view user IDs distinctly from keys:

# Long keyids are more collision-resistant than short keyids

# You should always know at a glance which User IDs gpg thinks
# are legitimately bound to the keys in your keyring:
verify-options show-uid-validity
list-options show-uid-validity

# If you use a graphical environment (and even if you don't) you should be using an agent:
